VCV rack - the wonderful absurdity of simulating analog signal processing using a massively powerful modern computer. The joy is akin to playing the Zachtronics games TIS-100 or Shenzen/IO. Begin with the immense power and flexibility of a modern computer, overlay a veneer of simplicity and constraint, then allow open experiment, then complexity and texture and life start to emerge.
