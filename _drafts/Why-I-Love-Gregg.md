I started getting into hand stenography after learning [Plover](http://www.openstenoproject.org/). What I looked for in a writing system mirrored what I loved about machine steno:

* As phonetic as possible
* Consistent and predictable to learn
* Fast

I also added criteria:

* Beautiful
* Fluid

Gregg shorthand met all of these, and more. The choice of curves and lines follows a host of predictable phonetic rules and (at least to me) seems to even echo the physiology of producing the respective sounds.
