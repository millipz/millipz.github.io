I'm so excited to have landed a role as a mentor on the [bootcamp](2024/06/01/Delivering-Data/) where I studied. I've joined right in the middle of a cohort, which means the students are deep in the weeds of studying cloud infrastructure. I'm re-learning and consolidating a lot of the content that I learned on the course, and clarifying some ideas that never quite stuck. One of the things I never truly understood was how `aws_iam_policy_document`s, `aws_iam_policy`s and `aws_iam_policy_attachments`s are related. I started making some code annotations to understand this, and it turned into a little cartoon. Hopefully someone finds this useful!
