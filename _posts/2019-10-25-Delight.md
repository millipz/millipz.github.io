With the release of iOS 13 I have enjoyed exploring the tweaks and changes in some of the most frequently used interactions. The volume indicator is particularly delightful. It is grabbable, grows when grabbed, has an informative animated icon and haptic stops top and bottom. It also pops on to the screen perfectly aligned with the hardware volume buttons. It is as if the physical act of pressing the buttons pushes the virtual slider onto the screen. This is Apple's famous hardware/software integration distilled into a tiny control. It may seem overkill, but I use this control hundreds of times per day, and now wonder how it could ever have been otherwise.
