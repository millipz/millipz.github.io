title: Writing to start writing
---
To begin, I need to begin. This post collects my first ideas of what this 'blog' will be and what it won't. All of this is very likely to change. I plan to:

* Write posts that collect my thoughts on various subjects. This writing is for my own practice and reflection

* Collect groups of links and references for the purposes of researching topics of interest
