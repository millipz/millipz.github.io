[VCV rack](https://vcvrack.com) - the wonderful absurdity of simulating analog signal processing using a massively powerful modern computer. The joy is akin to playing the Zachtronics games [TIS-100](https://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/) or [Shenzen/IO](https://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/). Begin with the immense power and flexibility of a modern computer, overlay a veneer of simplicity and constraint, then allow open experiment, then complexity and texture and life start to emerge.
