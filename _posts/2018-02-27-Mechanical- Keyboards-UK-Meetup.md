title: Mechanical Keyboards Meetup U.K.
---
I am a newcomer to both the word of stenography and that of mechanical keyboards. Being a designer, I do not often have to type large volumes of text, so might not be a typical user of stenography. However I was so impressed by some of Mirabai's talks online that I decided to build myself a mechanical keyboard in order to learn steno as a hobby.

The latest meetup of the [MKUK subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboardsUK/) was held on Saturday 24th February. A large part of the appeal of mechanical keyboards has been the inventiveness of the devices and the fun spirit of the community, so when an opportunity arose to meet some of the people and play with some of the toys, I jumped at it.

Being a newcomer, I expected to just go along and enjoy looking and poking at the beautiful keyboards of my fellow clackers, rather than displaying anything. However while discussing the event on the Plover Discord Group, I came up with the idea of setting up a little Plover demo for people to try out at the meetup.

As an enthusiastic beginner at stenography, I thought this would be a great way to spread the word about the open steno project and a good icebreaker at an event full of people I'd never met.

The venue was a basement meeting room in a Waterloo hotel, full of keyboards and enthusiasts. The event was buzzing and well attended, and I arrived in good time to get the laptop and keyboard set up and have a good browse around the room. There were also some generous giveaways throughout the session.

Although the idea was for my demo to be self explanatory, there was not quite enough information for a complete novice to try typing with any success, so I spent much of my time at the event standing by my laptop, talking people through the concepts of stenography and showing them how to stroke their first few words. Most had not tried stenography before, although I did meet one lapsed Plover user. The reception was even more enthusiastic than I had hoped, with a lot of interest, especially when I mention the potential typing speeds of 200+ wpm.

I answered many questions about the system and steno in general, from

> How would I type paraphernalia?

for which Plover's 'Lookup' function came in very handy, to

> is it very bound to the English language?

to which I answered "yes, but steno theories and keyboards exist for many languages!" (see the [Plover Discord Group's](https://discordapp.com/invite/0lQde43a6dGmAMp2) multilingual channel for more on this!). One of the most interesting questions I got asked was

> How did the first (pre-computer) steno machines work?

To answer this one I fired up the Plover 'Paper Tape' and explained that early machines recorded strokes that would be later hand translated back into English. It's these little features that made Plover truly fun to demonstrate, and I had a great time chatting to everyone who took an interest.

I've detailed my setup below for anyone who is interested, along with some thoughts on improving it next time. I had a great time at the meetup, and would love to have a go at demonstrating Plover again in the future, especially if I manage to build up some fluency in stenography. Thanks to all the welcoming folk of [r/MechanicalKeyboardsUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboardsUK/) and to Mirabai for inviting me to write this post!

# Demonstration Setup

- Macbook Pro, running:

  - Plover 4.0
  - [Learn Plover Excercises at Steno Jig](https://joshuagrams.github.io/steno-jig/) open in a Safari window -- Chosen because it offers hints in the form of a keyboard layout, which is very helpful for complete beginners
  - [Open Steno Project website](http://www.openstenoproject.org/) open in a second Safari window
  - An overlaid persistent window with the [Learn Plover! cheat sheet](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Yi93aHaxe3L-_ePtq3bujv7o1CCLmmgim8iuL_Sx2IY/preview?h=400&hl=en&w=1200), using the [Helium browser](http://heliumfloats.com/).

- Let's Split keyboard:

  - Standard layout with a layer added in QMK for stenography using the [TX Bolt keycodes](https://docs.qmk.fm/feature_stenography.html). Using these keycodes instead of letters allows me to still use the qwerty laptop keyboard without switching Plover output on and off.
  - Kailh speed silver switches -- light linear switches with a high actuation point.
  - Blank white PBT keycaps (Cherry profile I think).
  - Some handy letter stickers donated by my partner.

# Improvements

There are a few things I would do differently if I were to set up a Plover demo again. Hopefully this will be useful to anyone else who wants to demo Plover in a similar context.

- Step-by-step guide to making your first word, printed with large text and diagrams. This would help anyone trying out the demo when it is unattended. I think the first chapter of Zack Brown's [_Learn Plover!_](https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/) would be great if it could be boiled down to a single sheet of paper.
- Provide handouts or cards for people to take away with details of Plover and the Open Ssteno Project.
- Display names/links for:

  - The Open Steno Project website
  - The Plover Discord Group
  - The Plover subreddit

- Find time to make a demonstration to a larger group. This was not really suitable for this event, but would be a good way to demonstrate interest.
