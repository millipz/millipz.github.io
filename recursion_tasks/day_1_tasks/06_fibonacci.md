# The Fibonacci Sequence

## Instructions

Implement a recursive function that takes a number and returns the number at that point in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, `fib(1)` would return the first number in the sequence, `fib(2)` the second, etc.

You are not expected to come up with the Fibonacci formula yourself, just to implement it in Python.

In this problem, the Fibonacci sequence is as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,...

## Example

```py
fib(1) # 0
fib(2) # 1
fib(7) # 8
```
