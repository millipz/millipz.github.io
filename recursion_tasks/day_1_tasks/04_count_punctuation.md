# Count Punctuation

## Instructions

Implement a recursive function, `count_punctuation`, that counts the amount of punctuation in a string.

For this function, punctuation counts as `[",", ".", "!", "?"]`

## Example

```py
count_punctuation("") # 0
count_punctuation("!") # 1
count_punctuation("What, me?") # 2
count_punctuation("Ready? Set... Go!") # 5
```
