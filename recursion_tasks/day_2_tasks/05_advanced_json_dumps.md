# Advanced: json.dumps

## Instructions

Implement a [json.dumps function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-dumps-in-python/)

Just do it step by step, using TDD. Look into what constitutes acceptable [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp), and start off testing the simplest JSON dictionary you can think of and build from there.
