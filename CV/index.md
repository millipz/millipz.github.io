## Profile

I am a UK registered architect, technologist and educator

Having shifted from a design and management career in construction into the technology sector, I bring a unique perspective to technical challenges and products. 

In construction, I have experience at every stage of design, including practice management, administering contracts up to £5M, and lead architect on projects up to £10M. I have a wealth of experience of working with existing buildings, including many historic and listed buildings. I am a strong advocate for using appropriate technology to help improve the construction process on all projects, including BIM and workflow automation where possible.

I also have a keen interest in how design can help to address the challenges of development around the world, and increase the resilience of the poorest and most vulnerable communities.

Specialties: Appropriate Technology & Automation, Practice Management, Design Team Leadership, Complex Refurbishment, BIM, CAD Standards, 3D Modelling, Teaching & Training.
