# Miles J Phillips

## Architect

## Profile

I am a UK registered architect, with experience at every stage of design, including administering contracts up to £5M, and lead architect on projects up to £10M. I have a wealth of experience of working with existing buildings, including many historic and listed buildings.

I am a strong advocate for using appropriate technology to help improve the construction process on all projects, including BIM and workflow automation where possible.

I also have a keen interest in how design can help to address the challenges of development around the world, and increase the resilience of the poorest and most vulnerable communities.
